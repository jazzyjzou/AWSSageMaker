# AWSSageMaker

I'm following the original tutorial from AWS SageMaker K-means high level and try to modify it to MXNet, also learning things from SageMaker notebook mxnet_mnist.<br>
The jupyter notebook "MXNet_mnist" contains steps to do image classification by hand-written input.<br>
For the input of final predition, I wrote 4, and it is predicting the right result.
